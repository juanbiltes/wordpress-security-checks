## Installing Docker
0. Install [Docker for your O.S](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
1. Clone this repository
2. Open a terminal and access the directory where you've cloned this repository
3. Run this command `sudo docker-compose up -d`  and wait for everything to finish, although itÂ´ll exit, the server will be running in the background
3. Access your WordPress in `http://localhost:8000`
4. It'll probably ask you to setup the site, use the following config and then click on "Instalar Wordpress":
```
Titulo del sitio: Security Tests
Nombre del usuario: admin
contrasena: admin
confirma la contrasena: si, checked
tu correo: pepe@gmail.com
visibilidad en motores: no, unchecked
```
5. Done, now login with user `admin` and password `admin`
6. Last, add a host as this one. If you're on Linux/UNIX run `nano /etc/hosts` and add a line with this `127.0.0.1 wordpress-security.com`. We may use this in some tools.

## Usage
> Make sure your docker images are running. You can validate this using the docker dashboard (you've already installed it).

### Wordpress

#### Viewing the site
http://localhost:8000

#### Administration of the instance

# Notes

- Docker: 
  - We're using [the Docker image for WordPress that runs on php7.3 apache](https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/blob/master/php7.3/apache/Dockerfile). It should be similar to the real environment
